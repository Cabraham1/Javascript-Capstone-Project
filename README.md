# The Meal DB
The Meal DB is a web application that utilizes an external API from [https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?a=British] to showcase a list of meals. Users have the ability to interact with the meals by liking them, leaving comments, or reserving a meal using an involvement API. 

However, the reservation, Comments features has not been incorporated into the application due to limited group members. 

This project is the second Microverse capstone project designed to summarize the knowledge acquired in module 2. 

The objective of the project is to develop a dynamic web application that meets the standards of a professional web developer.

## How it works

The Meal DB web application allows users to like, comment, and make a reservation for their favorite meal.
* By clicking on `like button` the number of like is increased and stored in the involvement API;
* By clicking on the `Comment button` to display the description of the selected meal, the list of all comments, and added a new comment;
* By clicking on the `Reservation button` to display the list of all reservations and make a new Reservation;
